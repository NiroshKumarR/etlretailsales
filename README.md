# ETL Retail Sales Data Engineering Project

This project focuses on performing Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) operations on a Retail Sales dataset. The objective is to process the raw data, transform it into a suitable format for analysis, and store it in a PostgreSQL database. The transformed data can then be used for further analysis and generating insights.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the [Superstore Sales dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/jr2ngb/superstore-data) from Kaggle. It contains information about retail sales, including order details, product information, customer data, and sales performance metrics.

## Project Structure

- `ETL_Retail.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for performing ETL operations on the dataset.
- `data/superstore_dataset2011-2015.csv`: The raw data file in CSV format.
- `queries.py`: Python file containing the SQL queries used for analysis.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Psycopg2
- PostgreSQL

## Setup

1. Install the required Python packages by running the following command:
   ```
   pip install pandas psycopg2
   ```

2. Set up a PostgreSQL database and update the connection details in the Python code:
   - Host: Replace "your_host" with the hostname or IP address of the database server.
   - Port: Replace "your_port" with the port number used by the database server.
   - Database: Replace "your_database" with the name of the database.
   - User: Replace "your_user" with the username for accessing the database.
   - Password: Replace "your_password" with the password for accessing the database.

3. Execute the `ETL_Retail.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook to perform the ETL operations and store the transformed data in the database.

## Queries and Analysis

The notebook contains examples of SQL queries that can be executed on the transformed data to derive insights and answer business questions. The queries cover topics such as sales trends, top-selling products, revenue by region, customer behavior, and more. Feel free to modify or expand the queries based on your specific analysis requirements.

## Conclusion

The ETL Retail Sales Data Engineering project enables the extraction, transformation, and loading of retail sales data into a PostgreSQL database. By following the provided steps and customizing the code, you can adapt the project to your own dataset and gain valuable insights from the transformed data.
